Some special abilities and environmental Hazards, such as starvation and the longâ€”term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion (or fatigue). Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

|Level |Effect 
--- | --- 
|1| Disadvantage on Ability Checks
|2| Speed halved
|3| Disadvantage on Attack rolls and Saving Throws
|4| Hit point maximum halved
|5| Speed reduced to 0
|6| Death

A creature suffers the Effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on Ability Checks.

Finishing a Long Rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

## Suffering Exhaustion

**Cause **|**Details**
:-----:|:-----:
Forced March |For each hour spent traveling past 8 hours make a CON save at DC 10 + 1 for each hour past 8. On a failed save, a character suffers 1 level of exhaustion.
Starvation |If a creature doesn't eat enough food in a day, they start to starve. Food can be stretched out by eating half as much per day, which counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON mod, and then at the end of each day beyond that a character automatically suffers 1 level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating reduces the days without food to 0.
Dehydration |A creature who drinks less than half as much water than they need in a day must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers 1 level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If a character already has any levels of exhaustion, they gain 2 levels in either case.
Barbarian's Frenzy |A Barbarian who goes down the Path of the Berserker can choose to enter a frenzy if he is raging. When the rage ends, he suffers a level of exhaustion.
