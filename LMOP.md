The buildings are of stone and wood frame while the entrance to town is no more than an old dirt road. There is a small area of green at the centre of housing area as well as a small orchard within the grounds of the town. The areas to the west and south include small farmsteads while the old Tresendar Manor stands dilapidated on the hill to the east overlooking the town.

The cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.

**Light** Areas 1 & 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. 

**Rubble** Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain.
