## 1. Suprise

Determine who is surprised as combat is starting by comparing the Stealth checks of anyone hiding with the Passive Perception score of each creature on the opposing side.

## 2. Positions

Establish positions. The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are--how far away and in what direction.

## 3. Initiative

*Roll for Iniative!*

Players roll initiative by making a Dexterity check , adding any bonuses they might have. The DM rolls initiative for the opposing creatures or for the entire group.


## 4. Turn

Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.

**You can take your movement, action, and a possible bonus action in any order if not saying otherwise.**
